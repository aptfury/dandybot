## Welcome to dand-e bot
> [!NOTE]
> This bot is currently in the early stages of production and should not be used in its current state. If you are interested in using this bot for your server, please reach out to me personally so that I can set it up for additional servers.

This Discord bot was originally created for a private community server builty around roblox games. It has been tailored to that specific community and its needs, but is slowly being expanded upon. At present, there are not any plans to make this bot available outside of its current servers. However, if enough interest is shown, I may work on making this bot publicly available and including more generalized features and increase support for multiple servers.

#### Roadmap
At present, the roadmap is only planned out to the point of getting this bot functional enough to be used regularly for both community features and roblox gaming features. As issues are opened, this will likely be edited to include more tasks and milestones.
