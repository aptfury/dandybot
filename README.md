## Welcome to dand-e bot
> [!NOTE]
> This bot is currently in the early stages of production and should not be used in its current state. If you are interested in using this bot for your server, please reach out to me personally so that I can set it up for additional servers.

This Discord bot was originally created for a private community server builty around roblox games. It has been tailored to that specific community and its needs, but is slowly being expanded upon. At present, there are not any plans to make this bot available outside of its current servers. However, if enough interest is shown, I may work on making this bot publicly available and including more generalized features and increase support for multiple servers.

#### Roadmap
At present, the roadmap is only planned out to the point of getting this bot functional enough to be used regularly for both community features and roblox gaming features. As issues are opened, this will likely be edited to include more tasks and milestones.

###### Milestone: Reach v1.0.0
Dand-e Bot v1.0.0 will only be officially published and launched for use when it has met the following requirements:

- [x] Posts quotes by members in the correct quotes channel.
- [ ] Has a context menu option for quoting members.
- [x] Has modal submission forms for feature requests.
- [ ] Has a functional database that can reliably store and recall submitted information.
- [ ] Has a command for submitting Dandy's World data to the database.
- [ ] Has a command for submitting Dandy's World run data to the database.
- [ ] Has a command to register accommodations requests.
- [ ] Has a command to pull user information.
- [ ] Has a report to mods command.
- [ ] Role manager
- [ ] Entry and exit features

#### Feature Requests
You can request a feature either through the discord server this bot is in or through github issues for this repository. Requesting a feature does not gaurantee that it will be added, but does gaurantee that it will at least be considered.
